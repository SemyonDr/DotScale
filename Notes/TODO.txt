NOTE: TODO LIST
------------------------

You are fixing JpegWriter starting with the constructor

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
OVERALL	--------------------------------------------------------------------
Add Image Chunk processing support
Where appropriate change NULL to nullptr.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
IO	------------------------------------------------------------------------
	Add image metadata support using exiv2 library
	You may create PngInfo and JpegInfo objects that combine header and other parts of the file (like PNG chunks) and use it instead of just a header. Maybe is would also hold metadata, maybe it will be combined with metadata under yet another wrapper.
	
	PNG Support
		Add palette support.
			Palette reading, storing and writing
			Palette calculating using an algorithm (long term goal just for fun of it)
		Add PNG unknown chunks handler - just save them inside the header and write back as they were. Now decompressor is set to ignore by calling png_set_keep_unknown_chunks().
		Add gamma chunks support.
		Interlaced PNG may not work correctly with chunk reading. Requires investigation.
		
	JPEG Support
		Add gamma support

	Add utf8 paths support
	Scan IO objects and change NULL to nullptr wherever possible

Progress checklist when working on IO objects:

V PngReader
	V ReadFile
	V Constructor
	V ReadRows
PngWriter
	V WriteFile
	V Constructor
	V WriteRows
JpegReader
	V ReadFile
	V Constructor
	V ReadRows
JpegWriter
	WriteFile
	V Constructor
	V WriteRows

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Processing -----------------------------------------------------------------
	Chunk processing support
	Jobs

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Testers --------------------------------------------------------------------
	Move test images folder to project directory and set a variable somewhere  which will point to it.
	Write AddOutDir(dirname) which will add output directory for each test.
	Source file for the test should be copied to output directory and results should be saved there.
	Output dir should have number (time) at the end to distinguish it.
